*******Welcome to "Paper, Rock & Scissors Game"*********

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game for two players. The two players each make  choice of:

- rock
- paper
- pair of scissors

The winner of that round depends on the items formed. If the same item is formed, it's a tie. If a rock and scissors are formed, the rock wins, because a rock can smash scissors. If scissors and paper are formed, the scissors win, because scissors can cut paper. If paper and a rock are formed, the paper wins, because a sheet of paper can cover a rock. After one round is completed, they can start another round.
